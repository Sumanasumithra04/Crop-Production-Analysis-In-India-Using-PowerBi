# Crop-Production-Analysis-In-India-Using-PowerBi
For this project dataset was collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pyatakov/india-agriculture-crop-production

The dataset used in this project contains approximately 345,000 records across 12 columns: State, District, Crop, Year, Season, Area, Area Units, Production, Production Units, Yield, Year_transforme, and year-band. Some records had missing (NaN) values in the Production column, which were handled in Power BI by replacing them with 0 using conditional logic in Power Query.

The dataset covers agricultural data from 36 states and 719 districts across 6 different seasons — Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Winter, Autumn, and Whole Year — and includes 56 unique crops. After cleaning, a GROUPBY clause was applied to aggregate production values by district and crop, helping to summarize the production rate effectively.
